# assembly_tic_tac_toe_NN
The code in here is by no means a guide on how to do *anything* in assembly, it's just a simple learning project I did to learn basic assembly in order to understand how C/C++ works in depth.



It's to be assembled with MASM in Visual Studio, however I do not remember the exact project specifications I changed in order to make this possible. Assembling this program will not do anything fun either, it just shows stats for this specific run. 



The code was written in ~2.5 weeks because I also wanted to submit this as my project to my university, it's 2 weeks of basically sleeping and coding nonstop, however at some points I was just getting super exhausted and was doing random things, writting lyrics of my favorite song in comments in one file is the ultimate example


credits to "What's a Creel?" youtube channel, underrated channel about a lot of cool stuff, his modern assembly series have helped me set everything up and explained basic concepts:
